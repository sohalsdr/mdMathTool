Various utilities to make working with math in markdown easier
https://github.com/sohalsdr/mdMathTool

MODES
    Simple: Prompts user through individual arguments
    Advanced: Accepts all arguments at command start
    Batch: Same as Advanced, but converts a whole folder

USAGE
    SIMPLE:     java -jar mdMathTool_<version>.jar -s
    ADVANCED:   java -jar mdMathTool_<version>.jar -a <Source File> <Destination File> <Source Delimiter> <Destination Delimiter>

FORMATS
    Common math delimiters are $ and $$, although the program will accept any delimiter put in. In Advanced Mode, delimiters must be surrounded with ' '
(e.g. '$'). Simple mode does not require the ' ' (for whatever reason).
    If "github" is chosen as the destination delimiter, the program will render all detected equations into images for use with GitHub.
    For Batch mode, the <appendToFileName> flag is a string that will be appended to the end of the filename, before the extension. For example, if a folder you passed through batchmode had "test.md" and "anothertest.md", and you put "bananas" as appendToFileName, the output files would be "testbananas.md" and "anothertestbananas.md". appendToFileName cannot have any spaces.
