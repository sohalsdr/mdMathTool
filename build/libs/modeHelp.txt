Various utilities to make working with math in markdown easier
https://github.com/sohalsdr/mdMathTool

MODES
    SIMPLE:     Prompts user through individual arguments
    ADVANCED:   Accepts all arguments at command start
    BATCH:      Same as Advanced, but converts a whole folder
    QUICK:      You put in an equation, and it spits out a GitHub embed, as simple as that

USAGE
    SIMPLE:     mdmathtool -s
    ADVANCED:   mdmathtool -a <Source File> <Destination File> <Source Delimiter> <Destination Delimiter>
    BATCH:      mdmathtool -b <Source Folder> <Append To File Name> <Source Delimiter> <Destination Delimiter>
    QUICK:      mdmathtool -q
                or
                mdmathtool -q <equation>

FORMATS
    Common math delimiters are $ and $$, although the program will accept any delimiter put in. In Advanced Mode, delimiters must be surrounded with ' '
(e.g. '$'). Simple mode does not require the ' ' (for whatever reason).
    If "github" is chosen as the destination delimiter, the program will render all detected equations into images for use with GitHub.
    For Batch mode, the <Append To File Name> flag is a string that will be appended to the end of the filename, before the extension. For example, if a folder you passed through batchmode had "test.md" and "anothertest.md", and you put "bananas" as appendToFileName, the output files would be "testbananas.md" and "anothertestbananas.md". appendToFileName cannot have any spaces.
    In quick mode, if feeding the equation in as a commandline argument, it must be wrapped in quotations (e.g "x^2 = 10").
